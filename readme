🔐 Face-Lock Folder Access
A security-focused desktop application that restricts access to folders using facial recognition. The app ensures only the authorized user can open the folder — any unauthorized attempt triggers an automatic folder closure.

🧠 How It Works
Folder is opened → Triggers the app.

Camera activates → Captures the current user's face.

Face vector comparison:

Converts the stored authorized user's face into black and white.

Uses face recognition algorithm to extract facial features.

Converts features into a vector.

Repeats the same process with the newly captured face.

Cosine Similarity Check:

Compares both face vectors.

If similarity is above threshold, folder stays open.

If below, the folder closes immediately.

⚙️ Technologies Used
Python

OpenCV (cv2)

dlib or face_recognition

NumPy

Scikit-learn (for cosine similarity)

🚀 Features
🔒 Face-based access control

🖼️ Converts images to grayscale for feature extraction

📐 Cosine similarity for precise face match

🗂️ Real-time folder protection

👤 Works offline after initial setup

📸 Example Flow
First-time setup: Capture your face to register.

Next time you open the folder:

Camera turns on

Your current face is captured and processed

If it's you, access is granted

If not, access is denied and the folder is closed instantly

🛡️ Why Use This?
Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive folders

Lightweight and efficient

Easy to set up, yet hard to bypass

🧪 Setup & Usage
Clone this repo:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-lock-folder.git
cd face-lock-folder
Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the app:

python main.py
Register your face:

Follow on-screen instructions to capture your authorized image.

Link the folder you want to protect.

📂 Folder Integration
Note: Actual folder locking is simulated by closing the folder window using OS-level commands. This may vary by operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).

⚠️ Disclaimer
This is a project-level security app and should not replace enterprise-grade encryption or protection for highly sensitive files.
